# Rice-INDE577-Fall2023 - Data Science and Machine Learning

## Course Description:
INDE 577 - Data Science and Machine Learning is a comprehensive course designed to introduce and explore various machine learning algorithms, with an emphasis on theoretical understanding and practical implementation in Python. The course is divided into two main sections:

- **Unsupervised Learning**: Unlike supervised learning, unsupervised learning algorithms take a set of data that contains only inputs and find structure in the data, like grouping or clustering of data points.

### Unsupervised Learning Algorithms:
- [K-means Clustering](./K-means%20Clustering)

## Key Python Modules Used:
This repository heavily relies on the following Python modules for data processing, analysis, and visualization:
- `matplotlib`
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `seaborn`
- `sklearn`

For detailed implementations, please refer to the respective directories linked above.

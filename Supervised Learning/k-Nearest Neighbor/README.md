# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

This project utilizes the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to analyze and predict vehicle CO2 emissions based on various factors such as fuel consumption and engine characteristics.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset provides comprehensive information about different vehicle attributes, emphasizing fuel consumption and CO2 emissions:

- `Make`: Brand of the car
- `Model`: Model of the car
- `Vehicle Class`: Category of the vehicle
- `Engine Size(L)`: Size of the engine in liters
- `Cylinders`: Number of cylinders in the engine
- `Transmission`: Type of transmission
- `Fuel Type`: Type of fuel used
- `Fuel Consumption City (L/100 km)`: Fuel consumption in urban areas
- `Fuel Consumption Hwy (L/100 km)`: Fuel consumption on highways
- `Fuel Consumption Comb (L/100 km)`: Overall combined fuel consumption
- `Fuel Consumption Comb (mpg)`: Combined fuel consumption in MPG
- `CO2 Emissions(g/km)`: CO2 emissions measured in grams per kilometer

### Data Source

The dataset is sourced from [Canadian Fuel Consumption Guide Data](https://www.kaggle.com/debajyotipodder/co2-emission-by-vehicles) provided on Kaggle.

## K-Nearest Neighbors Model

The KNN algorithm, a versatile and simple machine learning method, is employed here to predict vehicles' CO2 emissions based on their fuel consumption patterns and engine characteristics. 

### Implementation

The implementation of KNN is done using Python, incorporating libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn for data manipulation, analysis, and model building.

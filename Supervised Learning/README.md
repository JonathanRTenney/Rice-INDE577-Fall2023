# Rice-INDE577-Fall2023 - Data Science and Machine Learning

## Course Description:
INDE 577 - Data Science and Machine Learning is a comprehensive course designed to introduce and explore various machine learning algorithms, with an emphasis on theoretical understanding and practical implementation in Python. The course is divided into two main sections:

- **Supervised Learning**: This involves learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs. It infers a function from labeled training data consisting of a set of training examples.

### Supervised Learning Algorithms:
- [Perceptron](./Perceptron)
- [Linear Regression with Gradient Descent](./Linear%20Regression%20with%20Gradient%20Descent)
- [Logistic Regression](./Logistic%20Regression)
- [Dense Neural Networks](./Dense%20Neural%20Networks)
- [k-Nearest Neighbor](./k-Nearest%20Neighbor)
- [Decision and Regression Trees](./Decision%20and%20Regression%20Trees)
- [Ensemble Learning](./Ensemble%20Learning)

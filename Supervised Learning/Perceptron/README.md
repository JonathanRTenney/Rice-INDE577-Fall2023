# Perceptron Model for Analyzing Vehicle Fuel Consumption

This project employs a Perceptron model to analyze the relationship between highway and city fuel consumption in vehicles, with a focus on the number of cylinders in the engine. The aim is to understand how different types of fuel consumption correlate with the engine's cylinder count.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset includes detailed information about various vehicle attributes, with a focus on fuel consumption and engine characteristics:

- `Make`: Brand of the car
- `Model`: Model of the car
- `Vehicle Class`: Category of the vehicle
- `Engine Size(L)`: Engine size in liters
- `Cylinders`: Number of cylinders in the engine
- `Transmission`: Type of transmission
- `Fuel Type`: Type of fuel used
- `Fuel Consumption City (L/100 km)`: Fuel consumption in the city
- `Fuel Consumption Hwy (L/100 km)`: Fuel consumption on the highway
- `Fuel Consumption Comb (L/100 km)`: Combined fuel consumption
- `Fuel Consumption Comb (mpg)`: Combined fuel consumption in miles per gallon
- `CO2 Emissions(g/km)`: CO2 emissions in grams per kilometer

### Data Source

Access the dataset on Kaggle: [CO2 Emission by Vehicles Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/debajyotipodder/co2-emission-by-vehicles)

## Perceptron Model

The Perceptron model, a foundational binary linear classifier in machine learning, is used here to discern patterns in how vehicles' fuel consumption (both city and highway) relates to the number of cylinders. 

### Implementation

The Perceptron is implemented using Python, with key libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib for numerical operations, data manipulation, and visualization, respectively.

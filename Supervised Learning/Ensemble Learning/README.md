# Ensemble Learning in Analyzing Vehicle Emissions

This project employs Ensemble Learning methods to analyze and predict Fuel Consumption from vehicles based on various features. The goal is to leverage the combined strength of multiple learning algorithms to achieve more accurate predictions than any individual model.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset, titled "CO2 Emissions Canada," includes a range of vehicle attributes with a focus on their emission characteristics:

- `Make`: Brand of the vehicle
- `Model`: Model of the vehicle
- `Vehicle Class`: Category of the vehicle
- `Engine Size(L)`: Engine size in liters
- `Cylinders`: Number of cylinders
- `Transmission`: Type of transmission
- `Fuel Type`: Type of fuel used
- `CO2 Emissions(g/km)`: CO2 emissions in grams per kilometer

Key preprocessing steps include removing duplicates, filtering out certain fuel types, and balancing the dataset across different fuel types.

## Ensemble Learning Approach

The project uses Ensemble Learning, which combines multiple machine learning algorithms to improve predictive performance. 

### Implementation

Python is the primary language for this project, utilizing libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation, Scikit-learn for modeling, and Matplotlib for data visualization.

## Data Analysis and Results

The project includes an extensive analysis of the dataset, focusing on emission trends across different vehicle types and fuel types. The Ensemble Learning models' performance is evaluated and compared to understand their efficacy in predicting emissions.

### Challenges and Insights

- The complexity of modeling emissions due to diverse vehicle attributes.
- Insights into the most significant predictors of CO2 emissions.

## Conclusion and Further Research

This project highlights the potential of Ensemble Learning in environmental data analysis. Future work may include exploring more complex ensemble models and extending the analysis to other environmental impact factors.

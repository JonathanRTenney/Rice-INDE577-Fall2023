# Linear Regression Using Gradient Descent

## Overview

This project employs a Linear Regression model with the Gradient Descent algorithm to analyze the relationship between CO2 emissions and highway fuel consumption in vehicles. The objective is to understand how CO2 emissions are influenced by the amount of fuel consumed on highways.

### Dataset

The dataset contains comprehensive information about various vehicle attributes, with a focus on fuel consumption and emission-related factors:

- `Make`: Car manufacturer
- `Model`: Car model
- `Vehicle Class`: Vehicle category
- `Engine Size(L)`: Engine size in liters
- `Cylinders`: Number of cylinders in the engine
- `Transmission`: Transmission type
- `Fuel Type`: Type of fuel used
- `Fuel Consumption City (L/100 km)`: Fuel consumption in the city
- `Fuel Consumption Hwy (L/100 km)`: Fuel consumption on the highway
- `Fuel Consumption Comb (L/100 km)`: Combined fuel consumption
- `Fuel Consumption Comb (mpg)`: Combined fuel consumption in miles per gallon
- `CO2 Emissions(g/km)`: CO2 emissions in grams per kilometer

#### Data Source

The dataset is available on Kaggle: [CO2 Emission by Vehicles Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/debajyotipodder/co2-emission-by-vehicles)

## Linear Regression Model

The Linear Regression model with Gradient Descent is employed to uncover insights into how CO2 emissions are related to highway fuel consumption. This regression technique helps us understand the linear relationship between these two factors.

### Implementation

The Linear Regression model is implemented using Python, leveraging key libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib for numerical computations, data manipulation, and visualization, respectively.

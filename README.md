### Repository Description: 
This repository covers algorithms from supervised learning and unsupervised learning. The algorithms are written in python from scratch, but also makes use of Scikit-Learn, Keras, and Tensorflow. A list of algorithms is shown below:


- **Supervised Learning**:
    - Model Building and Error Analysis
    - Linear Regression
    - Gradient Descent
    - Logistic Regression
    - Neural Nets
    - Support Vector Machines
    - k-Nearest Neighbors
    - Decision/ Regression Trees
    - Ensemble Learning

- **Unsupervised Learning**:
    - k-Means Clustering
    - Principle Component Analysis

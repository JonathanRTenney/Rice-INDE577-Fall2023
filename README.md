## Course Description:
INDE 577 - Data Science and Machine Learning is a comprehensive course designed to introduce and explore various machine learning algorithms, with emphasis on theoretical understanding and practical implementation in Python. The course is divided into two main sections:

- **Supervised Learning**: This involves learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs. It infers a function from labeled training data consisting of a set of training examples.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Unlike supervised learning, unsupervised learning algorithms take a set of data that contains only inputs, and find structure in the data, like grouping or clustering of data points.
